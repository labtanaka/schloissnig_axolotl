compareTADsizes.ipynb             This script compares the TADs and the genes therein in human and axolotl and outputs 
                                  the TADs that a similar in terms of the contained genes
                                  
findHomologousCNEs.ipynb          This script finds a human TAD for each human CNE and uses the homology between the TADs 
                                  (generated by compareTADsizes) to generate a lastz job and search for the axolotl counterpart 
                                  of the CNE in the respective axolotl TAD.
